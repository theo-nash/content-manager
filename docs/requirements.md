     - Develop unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all major services, actions, and providers.
   - **Automated Retry Mechanisms:**  
     - Integrate automatic retries for failed operations with clear audit logging.

## Low Priority

1. **Extended Platform Support**
   - **Additional Social Media Integrations:**  
     - Expand publication support to other platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram) as secondary requirements after Twitter and blog/Medium integration.
   - **Multi-Language Support:**  
     - Plan for future localization and multi-language content generation capabilities.

2. **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
   - **Granular Audience Segmentation:**  
     - Incorporate more detailed segmentation for performance analytics (e.g., demographic breakdowns, time-of-day analysis).
   - **Customizable Reporting Tools:**  
     - Enable users to create custom reports and dashboards tailored to their specific strategic needs.

3. **Developer & Extension Features**
   - **Plugin Extension API:**  
     - Expose APIs for third-party developers to extend functionality (e.g., adding new providers or evaluators).
   - **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring:**  
     - Provide advanced logging and monitoring tools for operational diagnostics and performance optimization.

4. **Machine Learning Feedback Loop**
   - **Continuous Learning:**  
     - Implement mechanisms for the system to learn from historical performance data and refine LLM prompt engineering and decision-making over time.

# Technical Requirements for AI Content Agent System

## 1. System Integration

- **ElizaOS Plugin Framework Compatibility**
  - The system must adhere to the ElizaOS plugin architecture and lifecycle hooks (initialization, shutdown, update).
  - Provide a standardized entry point (e.g., `src/index.js`) that registers services, actions, providers, and evaluators with ElizaOS.
  - Integrate with the client-twitter plugin (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/client-twitter) to handle Twitter posting and data fetching.

- **Leveraging Existing News Services**
  - Integrate the intellinews service to fetch and process news data. This integration should:
    - Use the intellinews serviceâ€™s API to retrieve current news, leveraging its caching, topic configuration, and duplicate detection mechanisms.
    - Ensure that data from intellinews is normalized and passed seamlessly into the content decision engine.

- **Inter-Component Communication**
  - Use an event-driven architecture (via modules such as `src/integration/events.js`) for asynchronous communication between components.
  - Ensure low-latency messaging and robust error handling on the event bus for seamless integration between services.

## 2. Performance & Scalability

- **Response Times**
  - The LLM Decision Engine (e.g., within `src/llm/decisionEngine.js`) should process prompts and return actionable decisions within an acceptable time frame (e.g., less than 3 seconds per decision cycle under normal conditions).
  - API calls through the client-twitter plugin and intellinews service must adhere to their respective rate limits, using caching strategies where applicable.

- **Scalability**
  - Design the system as a set of loosely coupled components (services, actions, providers, evaluators) that can be scaled independently.
  - Support horizontal scaling of critical components such as content generation and analytics services to manage increased data or traffic.

- **Resource Utilization**
  - Optimize the codebase for efficient memory and CPU usage, especially during peak operations such as bulk content generation or when processing large volumes of real-time data from Twitter and news services.

## 3. Reliability & Fault Tolerance

- **Error Handling**
  - Each component (services, providers, actions, evaluators) must implement robust error-handling routines and centralized logging (e.g., via `src/utils/logger.js`).
  - Implement automated retry mechanisms for transient failures, particularly when interfacing with external APIs (client-twitter and intellinews).

- **Graceful Degradation**
  - The system must continue operating in a degraded mode if specific components (such as the intellinews service) experience issues, ensuring that core functionalities (like content publication) remain active.
  - Incorporate fallback strategies for the LLM Decision Engine in case of unexpected outputs or external communication issues.

- **Persistence and State Management**
  - Ensure reliable persistence for critical data such as content drafts, content plans, and performance analytics.
  - Maintain and correctly restore state information during system restarts or shutdowns.

## 4. Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Modular Codebase**
  - Organize the codebase into clearly defined modules (services, actions, providers, evaluators, and LLM modules) to facilitate testing and future enhancements.
  - Follow consistent coding standards and document interfaces and responsibilities for each module.

- **Testing & Quality Assurance**
  - Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all major modules, maintained in a dedicated `tests/` directory.
  - Use automated testing frameworks to validate plugin behavior and ensure high test coverage for critical functions, particularly those handling external data from intellinews and the client-twitter plugin.

- **Documentation**
  - Maintain updated developer documentation (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/developer-guide.md`, `docs/api.md`) detailing component interfaces, integration points, and coding standards.
  - Include inline code comments and usage examples where applicable.

## 5. LLM Decision Engine and Content Workflow

- **LLM Interaction**
  - The system must construct well-structured prompts (via modules such as `src/llm/promptBuilder.js`) and reliably parse LLM responses using a dedicated parser (e.g., `src/llm/outputParser.js`).
  - Implement a central decision engine (`src/llm/decisionEngine.js`) that uses LLM outputs to generate actionable content recommendations while considering inputs from intellinews and Twitter.

- **Content Generation and Publication**
  - The content generation service must produce platform-specific content drafts (e.g., for Twitter and blogs) in alignment with approved content strategies and brand guidelines.
  - The publication service must schedule and execute content posting via the client-twitter plugin, while also handling confirmation and error reporting.
  - Include a user override/approval workflow to enable pre-publication review when required.

- **Progress Tracking and Analytics**
  - The analytics service must collect and store engagement metrics and other KPIs for each published content piece.
  - Implement a progress evaluator that maps content performance to master plan KPIs and generates periodic progress reports with actionable insights.
